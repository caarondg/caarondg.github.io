As a large company site that supports two languages and several recurring sections it was built with the content writer in mind. Giving freedom with what they want to display on each page of the site. With this, we used wordpress with it's new Gutenberg blocks. Additionally since it only provides the basic blocks we coded in our own custom blocks we made using ACF(Advanced Custom Fields).</p>",
    "contribution": "<p>In this project, I was tasked with the frontend layout, animation, and the creation of some custom blocks. Specifically the blocks with complex functionality and animations such as the milestones block found in <a href=\"https://www.brc.com.sg/about-us/who-we-are/\">here</a>. To make build the website faster I utilized the usage of Swiper JS for the carousels, ScrollReveal for the fade-in animation on scroll, and TailwindCSS as the CSS framework. The site also uses ReactJS to pull, sort, and search in data for the brochures and other downloadable documents</p>",
